The importance of python in data analysis is specified in this book and the primary focus has been on the structured data like tabular or csv files and also multiple tables of data using primary keys. Python is also having major libraries like pandas and scikit-learn which are majorly used in for analysis tasks not only that but also an excellent option for programming data related applications. Most importantly python could be very easy to use when compared to other languages.Python is also used for research purpose and for prototyping for major companies.Python comparatively takes longer time for the execution but that could be covered by  the time we spend for programming. Python could be challenging for build high level CPU-bound applications.Global Interpreter lock(GIL) is a mechanism that prevents multiple instruction at the same time. This might not be desirable, but there are many situations where we use multithreaded systems.There is also a python C extension where we could run parallel processing. NumPy is an open-source mathematical Python library.NumPy contains a multi-dimensional cluster. pandas is an open-source, BSD-authorized Python library giving superior, simple to-utilize information constructions and information examination devices for the Python programming language.
